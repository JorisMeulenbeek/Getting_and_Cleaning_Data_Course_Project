###Week 4 Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

My course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.
The R script,  run_analysis.R , does the following:

1.  Download the dataset 
2.  Read necessary info
3.  Load training and test datasets, and work with only the colums you need (mean and standard deviation)
4.  Load subject and activity data. 
5.  Merges the datasets

The result is file tidydata.txt.
